## LLM Memory (ai-memory)

Before answering or acting on durable project knowledge, recall from the ai-memory MCP
(server `memory-personal`, workspace `centralit`, project `resource-tenant`).

1. Read the project's agent rules.
2. `memory_query` (semantic recall) via the ai-memory MCP, for the relevant workspace/project.
3. Read the page markdown directly (or `/api/v1`) when the target path is known.
4. If a task discovers a canonical rule, gotcha, schema/contract, operational constraint, or
   product decision, persist it via `memory_write_page` and link related pages with `[[path.md]]`
   (page paths carry the `.md` suffix; links resolve by exact path).

Semantic decisions from conversation and debugging belong to the agent — recall before acting,
write back when you learn something canonical.
